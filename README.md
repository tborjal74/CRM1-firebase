# Overview

Important! Hello Everyone! This is a CRM integrated with a cloud database using Firebase to serve as a Baas platform for the application.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}

The CRM app benefits from Google's Firebase since it provides the developer to access a cloud database for free just by using APIs. There's only a cost when a project will cater more users and may require more data collection and if other features will be used from Firebase. The CRM App allows users to apply CRUD functions (insert, modify, delete and retrieve). 

Steps to Use the App:

1. Sign Up for an Account
2. Login with your credentials.
3. View Dashboard
4. Select Customer, Sales, or Tickets
5. Logout when done.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

My purpose for creating this application is to demonstrate my capability in using Cloud Databases like Firebase to create apps that can be secured and by making sure that data is more protected when other features in a Cloud Database is used like App Check and Realtime Database.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}
Firebase offers a lot of features that can be fit and beneficial for a lot of simple projects. It also allows AI assistance for helping with code logic. 

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
The database for this application has two parts. There's a separate database that handles all the created accounts and has a unique ID so everytime a different user logs in the app, it will only show the data created by that user in its session of the CRM. The data for the users belongs to the Authentication feature of Firebase.

There's also a separate table/collection or database for the customers, sales and tickets which belongs to the Realtime Database feature of Firebase. All data added for customers, sales and tickets generates a UID (unique identifier).
